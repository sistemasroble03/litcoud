Introduction



"Interviewing for a technical job is hard, and so is being the interviewer. You want to get that engineering job at Facebook, and we want to hire the best people (you!). Knowing what to expect on both sides can go a long way toward making the process work better."
- Carlos Bueno, an engineer in Facebook
Getting well prepared for an interview is important. However, preparing all questions asked is time consuming and stressful. The key points are practice and effective preparation.
