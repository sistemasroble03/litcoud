CLIP is a mobile terminal that allow merchants to accepts all cards available (Mastercard, Visa, Amex) and contactless payments like samsung pay and ApplePay. 

How it works
-First our customers need to download and install the iOS/Android app.
-Then they need to create a Clip account 
-Pair the Clip device with their mobile device, and start using it.

Behind the scenes Clip does these steps to charge merchant’s customers
-Cllip reads card data
-The point of sale system validates payment information correctness
-Clip establishes a connections with the merchant’s bank and sends a transaction
-There is an authorization response which is instantly displayed in the mobile device
-In 24 hrs merchants receive all the transaction in their personal bank account.

MAYBE Besides the payment device and the mobile App, Clip also offers customers with some Dashboards that enable customers to manage 


This sounds not that complex, but behind this process there’re a lot of things going on and since we handle/process very sensitive information we must ensure SECURITY and pass multiple certifications and audits.
For instance, we are compliant with:
-Banxico, bank of Mexico
-Rules and security policies by AMEX, Mastercard and Visa
-PCI payment card industry compliant, which is the international standard that dictates how to handle and store payment information.

To make all this work, Clip has several teams:
Fraud team
Mobile team
Data team
DevOps team
Settlement team
Payments team
UX team
IAM team
And many more, I don’t know them all.

This last one, is the one we are going to focus.
Let’s start by describing the team architecture. We have multiple services that talk to each other, so we can say we have a micro service architecture

Service-iam
Service-authorization
Service-device-manager
Service-device-fingerprint
Service-merchant-bank-account
Service-merchant-attributes
Service-merchant-api-keys
